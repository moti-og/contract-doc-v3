same thing for web and add-in

create a button that says "Take Me Back to OpenGov" 

place the button directly above the title of the document and below the top level banner
do not allow them to overlap on the screen
use the same gap as between the title and the availability banner

the button always shows up

clicking on the button opens a modal
the auto-plays this video

@https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ 

the title of the modal is -- "We're not going back! We're going forward!"

let users click outside the modal to close it

do not impact any other functionality

do not modify the existing state machine information, but you can add the logic for this button: everyone gets it all the time

style the button the same way as approve/reject buttons in the approvals actions tab

do not try and smoosh the button inline given the importance of vertical space management. create a new container for it

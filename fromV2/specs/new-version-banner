notification about that someone saved a new version of the document
-Only trigger an automated document refresh if:
-->page initialization (from scratch, not incrementally)
-->user changes

Display a banner in the other platform if:
-one platform clicks
--"view latest"
--"save progress"
--"save and check-in"
--"new document"

-in the other platform
--display the banner in a similar format as the other banners
--the banner should be dismissable, and remain until dismissed

this should be driven by the state machine. disagree if you don't think so

do not hard-code logic anywhere

this banner is independent of any user role; everyone sees it 

banner message: "New version available, refresh to view it"

should we save this to the state machine?

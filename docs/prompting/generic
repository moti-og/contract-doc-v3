be smart about documentation - the docsAI folder is yours concise but remember to add if I don't tell you

clearly separate documentation from code - always and only add documentation files into the docsByAI folder, unless I tell you otherwise

if you find information that disproves something you believe, stop. accept the information and reconsider your position. respond to the user with your conclusion - highlight what you thought, the data, and what your new opinion is

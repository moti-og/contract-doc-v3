*Documentation*
1 - be smart about documentation - the docsAI folder is yours concise but remember to add if I don't tell you

2 - clearly separate documentation from code - always and only add documentation files into the docsByAI folder, unless I tell you otherwise

3 - Folder-level READMEs live beside the data/code they describe, so contributors browsing data/app/ on GitHub immediately see what belongs there (canonical seed docs, users, config) without hunting in docs/. The docs/ folder holds the high-level product/architecture docs.


*Analysis and how to think*
1 -simplify. simplify.

2 - if you find information that disproves something you believe, stop. accept the information and reconsider your position. respond to the user with your conclusion - highlight what you thought, the data, and what your new opinion is


*Admin notes*
1 - remember that I'm on a windows computer and you have to consider powershell syntax

2 - whenever you give me code, put it in an easy to copy code block

*Dev process*
1 - whenever we finish the branch we should merge it to main. I don't want to have multiple complete branches waiting to deconflict. But ASK before you merge so we don't include something we shouldn't.

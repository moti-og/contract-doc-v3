I'm asking you to build a new feature.  I want you to help me brainstorm and iterate on my plan. Read and follow the steps below.

First, read the feature description file.

Second, summarize the feature back to yourself and record your initial impressions 

Third, go look at the relevant code.

Fourth, develop a rough plan for how you'd implement the feature.

Fifth, analyze the feature together, considering the user and build complexity. Look for all its strengths and weaknesses, updating your perspective based on the additional data (looking at the code). 

Sixty, revise your plan.

Do this entire sequence twice.

This represents is your best effort to implement the feature, as I have requested.

Now evaluate what you think of this feature, and this plan.

Respond to me with:

1) What do you hate about my feature? How would you improve it?
2) What do you love about my feature? How would you improve it?
3) How could you improve the implementation by changing the feature?
4) Grade the feature: value to user and complexity to build

SIMPLE UI CHANGES

read through this and create a to do list
let's work on them one at a time
generate a plan, challenge the plan, execute the plan, and test
once you have built what i asked, tell me and i can manually test
you should be writing unit tests at every step of the way

#completed this 8/12/5pm
first -- let's put everything in the two containers on the page. that means:

web:
--left side: user seleection toggle, approval status indicator, approval button and modal, document actions;
----there should be 2 drop-down lists and 1 button: 1 - list) user selection (existing), 2 - list) document actions (existing), and 3 - button) approval modal, next to the 0/5 status indicator

--right side: notifications, remove the "available for check-out status"
--make both columns the same width and height

add-in:
left side: same content 
right side: same content
BUT stack the containers in the add-in since they won't fit side by side, on top of each other. buttons on top and notifications on the bottom

second,
both web and add-in
--move the title of the document to just below the top banner (eg the document name is "Contract for Contracts" - don't hard code, that's just an example)
--move the status banner to directly below the title, above the two columns I described earlier
--move the viewer banner to be right above the status banner
--shrink the height of the status banner on the add-in by 10%

third,
both the add-in and the webpage
-they initialize with buttons that shouldn't be there such as override, send to vendor, and replace default document. the document dropdown doesn't appear. then it appears and the other buttons disappear completely. why?

fourth,
both add-in and web
-make the buttons in the add-in to be in the same type of dropdowns as the web
-use the same components if possible, so styles and colors are all the same

fifth,
both add-in and web viewer
-get rid of all the pink. just use a mixture of light grey, blue, and purple. low saturation

sixth,
web viewer
shorten the size of the banner by 50%, and same for the logo and font subtitle

seventh,
add-in
-add the "coming soon" pill to the top left of the banner
-align the styles, formatting, and content with the web viewer - ideally the same component but don't create too much complexity from that route. maintain simplicity.
-I want to be able to change the content of the message easily, so create a file with that content and put it in the same folder as other string content. DON"T duplicate, if this content lives somewhere else remove it. One source of truth only.
